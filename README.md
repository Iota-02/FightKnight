CS 596 Multiplayer Game Project. This is a two player pvp fighting Game
where each player can move side to side with 'A' and 'D' keys, jump 
with 'Space' key, attack with left click on ouse and block with right 
click on mouse. The game is meant to be played with a Host player and a Client player. 
The game is not properly finished yet as the Client
player does not take damage and the health bars do not update for them
as well as a few other issues. 
You can find the game files on the master branch of this repository.
FightingGame 2025-03-16 19-36-33.zip file contains a video showing a 
little demo of how the game works and whats yet to be fixed. 
Game files were able to upload to github but after downloading them and trying to start the game
an error messsage pops up and I am unable to start it, but all the files I used and made are in
the master branch of this repository.
